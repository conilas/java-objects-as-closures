# java-objects-as-closures

![Just help me please](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20716798/61732038-1c49cc00-ad53-11e9-9fc0-11a032a2635b.jpg)


Using java to handle state using closures instead of keeping the state in the object. I overly complicated it a bit so it could look more javish. U kno, idiomatic code, bruh.
I'm really sorry.
